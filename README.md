# CS411 Software Engineering
A4 Team 7: Ivy Chenyao, Jing Song, Gaby Rasson

Important Note: 
  Our original idea was to have users sending aid packages to people affected by natural disasters by Amazon, however, we found out later that we could not find an API that contains information (especially addresses) of worldwide charity organizations, many of them we found have organizations in the states only. Therefore, we changed our output to a to-do list which the users could select the job/training application they are interested in and add the application task to their Toodle To-Do list. 
  Since we have changed our project plan quite a bit, I reviewed some of the team assignments (in docs/) that we did earlier, and have made small changes to the documentations according to the changes on the project. You could view them under cs411-prject/docs/updated
